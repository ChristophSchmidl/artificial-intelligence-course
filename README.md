# Artificial Intelligence Course

My course about Artificial Intelligence that I'm going to give in the second half of 2019.



## Quotes

### Artificial Intelligence - Foundaitons of Computational Agents by David L. Poole and Alan K. Mackworth

- "Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is the field that studies the synthesis and analysis of computational agents that act intelligently"
- "It is arguable that intelligence is different: you cannot have fake intelligence. If an agent behaves intelligently, it is intelligent. It is only the external behavior that defines intelligence; action intelligently is being intelligent. Thus, artificial intelligence, if and when it is achieved, will be real intelligence created artificially."
- "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the established name for the field, but the term "artificial intelligence" is a source of much confusion because artificial intelligence may be interpreted as the opposite of real intelligence. For any phenomenon, you can distinguish real versus fake, where the fake is non-real. You can also distinguish natural versus artificial. Natural means occuring in nature and artificial means made by people."

## Books about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

* An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics) - 29. September 2017
	* If you do not have any experience when it comes to machine learning, statistical learning then this book might be for you. It does not go into great detail on mathematical formulas and is straight forward.
	* German Amazon link: https://www.amazon.de/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1543929780&sr=8-1&keywords=introduction+to+statistical+learning
	* American Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Statistical-Learning-Applications-Statistics/dp/1461471370/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1543937029&sr=8-1&keywords=introduction+to+statistical+learning

* The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics) - 2016
	* This books assumes that you have some experience in the field of machine learning and the mathematical formulas are getting more involved.
	* German Amazon link: https://www.amazon.de/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1543929780&sr=8-2&keywords=introduction+to+statistical+learning
	* American Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Statistical-Learning-Prediction-Statistics/dp/0387848576/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1543937167&sr=8-2&keywords=The+Elements+of+Statistical+Learning

* Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop - 2007
	* This book is really technical and dense in terms of mathematical formulas. You probably have to read chapters several times before you get it but it offers a lot of information and is one of the best books out there when it comes to machine learning.
	* German Amazon link: https://www.amazon.de/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738/ref=sr_1_1?s=books-intl-de&ie=UTF8&qid=1543937901&sr=1-1&keywords=pattern+recognition+and+machine+learning

	* Online available: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf

* Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig
	* A classic about Artificial Intelligence in general. Many different topics are covered like informed search strategies, language models, reinforcement learning and many more.
	* German Amazon link: https://www.amazon.de/Artificial-Intelligence-Modern-Approach-Global/dp/1292153962/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1543942074&sr=8-1&keywords=artificial+intelligence

* Deep Learning (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron Courville - 18. November 2016
	* A nice book about deep learning by Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
	* German Amazon link: https://www.amazon.de/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1543942452&sr=8-1&keywords=deep+learning
