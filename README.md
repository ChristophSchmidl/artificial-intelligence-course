## Books

* An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics) - 29. September 2017
	* If you do not have any experience when it comes to machine learning, statistical learning then this book might be for you. It does not go into great detail on mathematical formulas and is straight forward.

* The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction, Second Edition (Springer Series in Statistics) - 2016
	* This books assumes that you have some experience in the field of machine learning and the mathematical formulas are getting more involved.

* Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher M. Bishop - 2007
	* This book is really technical and dense in terms of mathematical formulas. You probably have to read chapters several times before you get it but it offers a lot of information and is one of the best books out there when it comes to machine learning.
